- `python main.py --save`: save the model for upload to Fomoro
- `python main.py --test`: evaluate the model on the MNIST test set
- `python main.py --kaggle`: write model predictions on the Kaggle test set for upload to the [digit recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
- `python main.py --train`: train the model locally (for bug checking)
